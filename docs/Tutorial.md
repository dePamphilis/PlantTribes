This tutorial uses the test data `assembly.fasta`, a small set of *de novo* transcriptome contigs, in the [test](../test) subdirectory of PlantTribes installation to show how to perform an analysis using the various pipelines of PlantTribes.

The following command will post processes a de novo transcriptome assembly, `assembly.fasta` using the ESTScan coding regions prediction method with Arabidopsis thaliana
