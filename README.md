# PlantTribes
## Overview
PlantTribes is a collection of automated modular sequence and gene family  analysis pipelines for plant evolutionary studies. It post-processes *de novo assembly* transcripts into putative coding sequences and their corresponding amino acid translations, estimates paralogous/orthologous pairwise synonymous/non-synonymous substitution rates for a set of gene sequences, classifies gene sequences into pre-computed orthologous plant gene family clusters, and builds gene family multiple sequence alignments and their corresponding phylogenies.
